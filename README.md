Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App

(11/30/16 Update): After submitting the "Contact Us" form, an email containing the three text-fields are sent to me.

(12/24/16 Update): Users can now sign-up with either the 'Basic' or 'Pro' membership plans. I am using Stripe in "Test Mode", so even if you enter valid credit card information, you won't be charged. You don't need to enter a valid credit card number either, just input any 16-digit number.
